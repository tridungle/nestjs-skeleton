/**
 * Each interceptor implements the intercept() method. This method takes two arguments.
 * The first argument is the ExecutionContext. This is inherited from the ArgumentsHost.
 * The second argument is an instance of CallHandler.
 * ExecutionContext derives several helper methods from ArgumentsHost.
 * Basically, this allows us to build more generic interceptor.
 * On the other hand, CallHandler implements the handle() method.
 * Basically, this method can be used to invoke the route handler.
 * In other words, if we donâ€™t call the handle() method, our request will not reach the route handler.
 * Also, handle() returns an RxJS observable. This provides a wide range of operators to manipulate the stream.
 * In the above example, we use the tap() operator.
 * This operator invokes an anonymous function that logs something upon graceful termination of the stream.
 * In other words, during the response cycle.
 * Lastly, interceptors can also inject dependencies using the constructor.
